 * figure out a way to install level maps somewhere sensible at that the
   module can find on install (or additional instructions on "get a
   directory of level maps, and then...")
 * automatic level design? -- err uh
 * better animate player death so they can see what exactly caused it?
 * monster spawns over time? if so, how?
 * may need to weaken the ITEM and ANI refs in the LMap?
 * avoid repeated messages or use a xN indicator to tally repeats
 * non-player moves will need more nuance if want animates to not trip
   over one another, e.g. when a row of them moving towards player and
   the first one is the last in this list
 * may want fuses on bombs, or that they explode at end of fall
 * maybe explicit monster freeze of monsters following rotate instead of
   them (maybe) chasing a now very wrong target? (or different levels of
   difficulty and then different track_hero updates)
