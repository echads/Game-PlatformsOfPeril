                       The Platforms of Peril

                    ############################

Platforms of Peril is a terminal-based game. Assuming App::cpanminus
(and possibly also local::lib) is installed and setup, in a suitable
terminal (possibly one with a square font such as White Rabbit and a
black background) install and run the game via:

    cpanm Game::PlatformsOfPeril
    pperil


There is some documentation about the game:

    perldoc Game::PlatformsOfPeril


For the source code, see:

https://github.com/thrig/Game-PlatformsOfPeril

This can be built and installed (with dependencies) by running:

    git clone https://github.com/thrig/Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    cd Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    cpanm File::ShareDir::Install
    cpanm .

or without dependencies the manual old fashioned way:

    perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

Level maps are ASCII files; these are installed to

    perl -MFile::ShareDir=:ALL \
      -E 'say dist_dir q(Game-PlatformsOfPeril)'

or can be found in the git repository.
