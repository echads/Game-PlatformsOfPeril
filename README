                       The Platforms of Peril

                    ############################

Platforms of Peril is a terminal-based game. Assuming App::cpanminus
(and possibly also local::lib) is installed and setup, in a suitable
terminal (possibly one with a square font such as White Rabbit and a
black background) install and run the game via:

    cpanm Game::PlatformsOfPeril
    pperil

However this does not do much as level maps are not (yet?) shipped
with the module on CPAN. In the meantime try something like:

    git clone https://github.com/thrig/Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    cd Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    pperil


There is some documentation about the game:

    perldoc Game::PlatformsOfPeril


For the source code, see:

https://github.com/thrig/Game-PlatformsOfPeril

This can be built and installed by running:

    cd Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Or to pull in the dependencies automatically and then install:

    cd Game-PlatformsOfPeril
    cpanm .
